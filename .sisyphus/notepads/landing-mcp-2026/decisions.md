# Decisions

- 2026-02-16: Set Playwright default port to `3100` to avoid collisions with local services on `3000`.

- 2026-02-16: Add testimonial company-initial badges and relabel trust chip to `Case study` to make social proof feel more editorial and less generic.

- 2026-02-16: Add command-panel sync state tiles in Hero (`Data sync`, `Next digest`) to reinforce live-system credibility without changing CTA or section behavior.
- 2026-02-16: Upgrade mobile sticky CTA with richer gradient container and directional cue iconography while preserving the same anchor and `mobile-sticky-cta` selector.

- 2026-02-16: Elevate shared button tactile feel (subtle top highlight + active press offset) at the primitive level to improve consistency across hero/CTA/actions without changing selectors.
- 2026-02-16: Add subtle hover/focus lift to testimonial card triggers to improve perceived interactivity while keeping card selection logic and test IDs unchanged.
- 2026-02-16: Add a compact `Live` status chip in the Hero command panel header to reinforce real-time product perception without changing command panel behavior.
- 2026-02-16: Add smooth-scroll and themed scrollbar styling at global CSS level to improve navigation feel and polish without touching component logic or test hooks.
- 2026-02-16: Add a thin gradient top accent line to testimonial cards for stronger visual hierarchy while preserving existing testimonial interactions and selectors.
