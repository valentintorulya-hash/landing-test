# Draft: Landing Redesign Artistry

## Requirements (confirmed)
- User wants a substantial redesign of the current site.
- Current perception to fix: design looks weak and AI-generated.
- User explicitly asks to find strong references and use them to strengthen the project.
- User requested an artistry-oriented approach with `frontend-ui-ux` skill.

## Technical Decisions
- Planning mode only: produce a structured execution plan after requirements are clarified.
- Research-first workflow: run codebase exploration and external reference scans before finalizing scope.

## Research Findings
- Pending: codebase UI audit via explore agent.
- Pending: external benchmark/reference scan via librarian agent.

## Open Questions
- Which visual direction should be prioritized (premium minimal, bold futuristic, editorial, etc.)?
- Should redesign stay single-page only, or include supporting sections/components beyond current scope?
- Any competitor/reference sites that must be matched or avoided?

## Scope Boundaries
- INCLUDE: major visual and UX quality uplift of current landing.
- EXCLUDE (default): backend/business logic changes unless explicitly requested.
